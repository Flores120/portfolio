    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><h2>Highschool career</h2>My name is Alvaro Flores and I just graduated McMinnville high scchool in June 2016. I did acceptionally well in high school, as my diploma can prove it. I wrestled in high school qualifying for state 3 years in a row and becoming a finalist my last season of wrestling. I loved to wrestle it was everything to me. Most of my time was comitted toward wrestling and being part of a team with my friend Bobby. <h2>Hobbies</h2>When I'm not wrestling I like to enjoy relaxing and creating some sketches.<h2>Job experience</h2>My job experience has been working in a small fast food restuarant called Muchas Gracias. I mostly was at cash register but swutched over to cook later on.</p>
